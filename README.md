## Background

This project was inspired by [shaka-player-vuejs](https://github.com/davidjamesherzog/shaka-player-vuejs), but uses a more modern tech stack with Shaka Player version 4 (instead of Shaka Player version 3), Vue 3 (instead of Vue 2) and Vite (instead of Vue CLI).

## Features

You can select from a list of 6 sample videos and watch the chosen video.

## Video files

The manifest and image files of all sample videos used in this project are sourced from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).
The original video manifests have been converted from WebM to MP4 format with [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg), using this example command:

```sh
ffmpeg -i https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Coyote_Keeping_a_Watchful_Eye.webm -c:v libx264 -profile:v main -vf format=yuv420p -c:a aac -movflags +faststart -crf 30 public/videos/TgvHMDTQENg_manifest.mp4
```

The converted manifest and the image of each video are stored in the [videos](./public/videos) directory.
